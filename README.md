### 👨‍💻 Senior Software Engineer | Full-Stack (React • Node.js)

7+ years of hands-on experience building, refactoring, and experimenting with web applications.  
I focus on **frontend architecture**, **state management**, and **maintainable system design**.

Most repositories here are **learning-driven implementations** — POCs, architecture experiments, and tech explorations.

## 📦 Labs / Learning Repositories

These repositories are **intentional learning artifacts**, not production systems.  
They reflect how I evaluate tools, patterns, and architectural trade-offs.

🔹 **react-shadcn** – Component composition & design systems with ShadCN + Tailwind  
🔹 **nodejs-clean-architecture** – Clean architecture principles applied to Node.js  
🔹 **SPFX-PNPJS-V3** – SharePoint Framework experiments using PnP JS v3  
🔹 **react-micro-frontend** – Exploring micro-frontend boundaries & integration strategies  

> ⚠️ Educational purpose only. Stability, security, and edge-case handling were not production priorities.
