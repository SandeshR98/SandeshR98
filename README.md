# Hey, I'm Sandesh 👋

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** working across the full stack, frontend and backend, with deep experience in both.
I care deeply about **how things work under the hood**. Not just making things work, but understanding *why* they work.

Over 7+ years I've built and shipped production applications, but most of what lives here on GitHub is different.
It's **deliberate, hands-on exploration**: picking up a tool, pushing it to its limits, and building something that reveals the trade-offs.

> 🔎 Current obsessions: React performance · scalable frontend architecture · system design

## 🧪 Labs / Learning Repositories

These repositories are **intentional learning artifacts**, not production systems.
They reflect how I evaluate tools, patterns, and architectural trade-offs.

- ⚡ **react-scale** — High-performance React SPA rendering 100K virtualized product cards. TanStack Virtual, Web Workers, TanStack Table, shadcn/ui, full-text search, and React concurrent features (`useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`)
- 🎨 **react-shadcn** — Component composition & design systems with ShadCN + Tailwind
- 🏛️ **nodejs-clean-architecture** — Clean architecture principles applied to Node.js
- 🔷 **SPFX-PNPJS-V3** — SharePoint Framework experiments using PnP JS v3
- 🧩 **react-micro-frontend** — Exploring micro-frontend boundaries & integration strategies

> ⚠️ Educational purpose only. Stability, security, and edge-case handling were not production priorities.
