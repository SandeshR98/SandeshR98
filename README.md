# 👋 Sandesh Rathnayake

### 💻 Senior Software Engineer | Full-Stack (React · Node.js)

7+ years of hands-on experience building, refactoring, and experimenting with web applications.
I focus on **frontend architecture**, **state management**, and **maintainable system design**.

Most repositories here are **learning-driven implementations** - POCs, architecture experiments, and tech explorations.

## 🧪 Labs / Learning Repositories

These repositories are **intentional learning artifacts**, not production systems.
They reflect how I evaluate tools, patterns, and architectural trade-offs.

⚡ **react-scale** - High-performance React SPA rendering 100K virtualized product cards — TanStack Virtual, Web Workers, TanStack Table, shadcn/ui, full-text search, and React concurrent features (`useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`)
🎨 **react-shadcn** - Component composition & design systems with ShadCN + Tailwind
🏛️ **nodejs-clean-architecture** - Clean architecture principles applied to Node.js
🔷 **SPFX-PNPJS-V3** - SharePoint Framework experiments using PnP JS v3
🧩 **react-micro-frontend** - Exploring micro-frontend boundaries & integration strategies

> ⚠️ Educational purpose only. Stability, security, and edge-case handling were not production priorities.
